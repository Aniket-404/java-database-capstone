This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve all other modules. The application interacts with two databasesâ€”MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn delegates to the appropriate repositories. MySQL uses JPA entities while MongoDB uses document models.

1. Request Initiation: A user or client application sends an HTTP request. This could be a request for a web page like an admin dashboard or an API call for patient data.

2. Controller Routing: The request is received by the application and routed to the appropriate controller. Requests for the Admin and Doctor dashboards go to an MVC Controller, while all other API requests are handled by a REST Controller.

3. Service Layer Processing: The controller, regardless of its type, calls methods in the shared Service Layer. This layer contains the core business logic and is responsible for orchestrating data operations.

4. Repository Delegation: The service layer determines which database to query and delegates the task to the corresponding repository. It calls a JPA Repository for MySQL data (like patients or appointments) or a Mongo Repository for MongoDB data (prescriptions).

5. Database Interaction: The chosen repository communicates with its designated database. The JPA repository uses JPA entities to interact with the MySQL database, while the Mongo repository uses document models to interact with the MongoDB database.

6. Data Flowback: The database returns the requested data to the repository, which passes it back up to the service layer, and then to the controller that initiated the call.

7. Response Generation: Finally, the controller sends a response back to the client.

    The MVC Controller uses Thymeleaf to render an HTML web page and sends it to the user's browser.

    The REST Controller serializes the data into a format like JSON and returns it as the API response.
